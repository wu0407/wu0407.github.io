sdsdI'm building a business website with a blog, but can't see how to easily add more static pages beyond the index.html template.

My question/issue is the same as Ryan's here: http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-static-content-that-uses-partials/265

So I need to be able to use partials too. I feel like having an about.html in the layouts file should exist at site.com/about/ ?

Is there something we're missing?<!--more-->
